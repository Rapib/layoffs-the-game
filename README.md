# layoffs-the-game

Team FTL: Kyle Freemantle, Jonathan Tsai, Thomas Lau

It's 2023, and the layoffs are happening! Leadership has asked you to go through the current stack of employees and decide who gets to stay.

This web game will utilize a left-right decision making mechanism simulating a overworked HR manager at a big tech company. The user will be presented with a simulated HR graph of an employee's performance and will have to make a binary descision to retain or fire the worker. The user will have to swipe right to keep or swipe left to fire, which affects two major KPIs: Money and Morale. Both Money and Morale will have an upper limit to be defined, and a lower limit of zero. If either Money or Morale goes too high or too low, the game ends with the company folding over. If the user gets through the time limit without violating the boundaries, they win and the company survies, and a score is rendered as a composite of the Money and Morale metrics. They will then be able to brag to their friends about their cutthroat business acumen.
