        <article>I'm Kyle, and I am a software developer currently studying at Code Fellows.  Prior to this I did my best work in healthcare tech, spending 7 years in increasingly complex analyst and IT support roles.  I chose to pursue software development because the most fun I've ever had professionally has been working with engineering to implement the product team's designs.  I am certain that having lived in the support and product worlds gives me invaluable context for software design that I could only gain by first hand experience.<br>
        I would like to use my powers for good and go back into healthcare tech at a small or medium sized company.  I'm a Marine Corps veteran who struggled very badly for over a decade before I even tried to get help.  It is very important to me that the work I do could be helping someone else who is struggling too.  Thanks for your time.</article>

        <article>I am Thomas, a software developer with a military and filmmaking background. I am always interested in Software Development and always want to get into coding. Which is why when I want to make a career transition few months ago, I picked software development. Every website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I believe there are many opportunities for me as a beginner developer to help make a better website for all kinds of companies. I used to be a squad leader and worked as a team, and that gave me a lot of learning opportunities as a leader and a team member.</article>
